# CS-290
Web Development

For this class the term was centered around a project with the purpose of making a fully functioning website that uses languages that we learned in class that include PHP, CSS, javascript, SQL, and html. The website my group and I made is a bookstore website for students to buy and sell textbooks for cheaper prices than what was offered at the traditional book store. The main tabs of buy and sell are limited to students with only a OSU ID and password, this served as our security and login which prevents the website from unauthorized users. We incorporated various APIs as well to make the website more appealing to the customers by including a merchandise store that works with paypal as well as live twitter and instagram clients to showcase what it would be like with an active community. In the buy and sell page we also incorporated an adaptive map through Google Maps that lets the seller choose the meeting point for where the books can be sold to the buyer.
